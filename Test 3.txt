The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of 
summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among 
them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go 
with his lord father and his brothers to see the king's justice done. It was the ninth year of 
summer, and the seventh of Bran's life. 

The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, 
his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to 
think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, 
she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl 
children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with 
the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children. 

But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king's justice was 
old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and 
he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that his furs were 
ragged and greasy.
